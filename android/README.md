# Android Project

We love Twitter and several of our products interact with it. This goal of this
project is to build a simple Twitter client.

If any special requirements have been conveyed to you from your interview
team, they supercede the following.

## Requirements

- [ ] The application should be built with Java. You are free to use any IDE you wish.
- [ ] The application should be able to run on a Simulator of your chosing.
- [ ] The deliverable should contain complete steps for setting up an environment to run the application. Assume that we have never developed anything on Android.

## User Stories

- [ ] The user should authenticate with Twitter.
- [ ] The user should be able to post a new tweet.
- [ ] The user should be able to view historical tweets from their timeline.
- [ ] The historical tweets should be stored locally. (You don't need to store
  all of the user's tweets, just some of them.)
