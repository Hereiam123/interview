# HTML/CSS - Interview

We believe that a good front-end should be built using semantic markup and well-structured CSS. To that end, it's important that our front-end developers demonstrate the ability to convert a mocked-up page image into well-written code. The goal of this excercise is to take the mockups provided and build an HTML/CSS representation of them.

## Requirements

- [ ] Do not use a front-end framework such as bootstrap.
- [ ] You can choose to either include the filler text as written, or provide your own.
- [ ] Use the images provided in the assets directory where applicable.
- [ ] The page should be responsive rather than have a separate mobile version.
- [ ] Aside from the provided images, no other images should be used in the creation of your page.
- [ ] If you do not have access to the Helvetica font, you may substitute with a sans-serif of your choosing.
- [ ] You must use a CSS preprocessor to build your page. You may use Sass or Less.

## Bonus Points
Instead of hiding the navigation menu on mobile devices, adapt it into a mobile-friendly interface of your design. You may use JavaScript to achieve your desired results.
