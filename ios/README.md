# iOS Project

We love Twitter and several of our products interact with it. This goal of this
project is to build a simple Twitter client.

If any special requirements have been conveyed to you from your interview
team, they supercede the following.

## Requirements

- [ ] The application can be built with Objective-C or Swift.
- [ ] The application should be able to run on the iPhone Simulator.
- [ ] The application should contain at least two view controllers.

## User Stories

- [ ] The user should authenticate with Twitter.
- [ ] The user should be able to post a new tweet.
- [ ] The user should be able to view historical tweets from their timeline.
- [ ] The historical tweets should be stored locally. (You don't need to store
  all of the user's tweets, just some of them.)
